# Data Science Colabs

This hosts all my Colab projects from my Data Science specialisation when I pursued my university degree.

In addition, you can check out my Tableau visualisations [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/eileen.tong.hui.guan)

## Scraping from Twitter using Twint, then performing NLP cleaning and analysis
Focused on data cleaning. Text cleaning, language filtering, and text normalisation. Biggest effort went to an attempt at hashtag and glued words splitting. ("thisissomegluedwords" -> "this is some glued words")

## Weather prediction
Pre-processing weather data, analysing feature importance through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), resampling data for machine learning, and building logistical classifiers to predict whether it rains tomorrow.
